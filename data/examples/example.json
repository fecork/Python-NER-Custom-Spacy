    "While bismuth compounds (Pepto-Bismol) decreased the number of bowel movements in those with travelers' diarrhea, they do not decrease the length of illness.[91] Anti-motility agents like loperamide are also effective at reducing the number of stools but not the duration of disease.[8] These agents should be used only if bloody diarrhea is not present.[92]\n\nDiosmectite, a natural aluminomagnesium silicate clay, is effective in alleviating symptoms of acute diarrhea in children,[93] and also has some effects in chronic functional diarrhea, radiation-induced diarrhea, and chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.[45] Another absorbent agent used for the treatment of mild diarrhea is kaopectate.\n\nRacecadotril an antisecretory medication may be used to treat diarrhea in children and adults.[86] It has better tolerability than loperamide, as it causes less constipation and flatulence.[94]",
